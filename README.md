# Noteworks

## Overview

**Noteworks 5** is a web-based note-taking application I developed to strengthen my skills in full-stack web development and user-centered design. The app provides a clean, intuitive interface for organizing ideas, tasks, and study material‚Äîideal for students, professionals, or anyone looking to manage information effectively.

Designed with simplicity and usability in mind, Noteworks 5 includes essential note-taking features such as rich text formatting, folder organization, user authentication, note collaboration, and search. It also introduces smart AI productivity tools that distinguish it from typical note apps:

- **Recall Boost (Coming Soon)**  
  Transform your notes into#study-ready formats designed to reinforce memory and retention.
